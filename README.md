This project is designed for the 4 bit ring counter. 
This ring counter if made of 4 D flipflops. 
Number of flip-flops used =  Number of states in a ring counter
A common use of the Shift register is as a ring counter. The shift counter and the ring counter are nearly identical. The main difference is that, whereas it is attached to the input of the first flip-flop in the case of the ring counter, it is taken as an output in the shift resister.
